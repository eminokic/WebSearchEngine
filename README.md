# WebSearchEngine
A rudimentary web search engine, I developed in my algorithm design class.

## Summary
The search engine receives a search query from the user and outputs ranked list of web pages that are relevant to the search query.

### Overall Functions
- Crawl the web and download contents of web pages and construct the web graph. Using the web graph structure, determine the importance for each web page.


- Based on the contents of the webpages, build a data structure known as inverted index. The inverted index is designed so that the online computation—retrieving a ranked list of pages relevant to a search query—is done very efficiently.
